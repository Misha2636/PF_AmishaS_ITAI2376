Each module folder contains the assignments, notes, and projects related to that specific topic. Key highlights from specific areas are detailed below:

## Key Highlights

### Final Project

* **Description:** The final project involved the creation of an interactive AI tutor designed to teach Python programming. The agent provides explanations, poses coding challenges, and tracks the user's progress, offering personalized guidance throughout the learning process.
* **Key Technologies/Skills Used:** Python programming, Natural Language Processing (NLP) for interactive dialogue, state management for tracking user progress, potentially web development frameworks (if deployed as a web application).
* **Link to Project Files:** (Optional) You can mention the specific folder within the repository where the final project files are located (e.g., `AI_Tutor_Agent/`).
* **Brief Reflection:** This project allowed me to integrate my understanding of Python with the principles of creating interactive AI agents. The challenges involved in designing effective pedagogical interactions and accurately tracking user progress were significant learning experiences.

### Midterm Project

* **Description:** The midterm project focused on implementing a diffusion model from scratch to generate images from the MNIST dataset. This involved a deep dive into the forward and reverse diffusion processes and the U-Net architecture.
* **Key Technologies/Skills Used:** Python, PyTorch, Deep Learning, Diffusion Models, U-Net Architecture, Time Embedding, CLIP Evaluation (conceptual understanding), Model Conditioning.
* **Link to Project Files:** (Optional) Mention the relevant folder (e.g., `Diffusion_MNIST/`).
* **Brief Reflection:** This project provided a strong hands-on understanding of generative models and the intricacies of diffusion processes. Overcoming technical hurdles during implementation and debugging significantly enhanced my problem-solving abilities in the field of deep learning. The exploration of concepts like time embedding and CLIP evaluation deepened my theoretical knowledge.

### MSLE Skillable Labs

This section highlights my engagement with the MSLE Skillable Labs and the skills I practiced:

* **Lab Activities:** I completed labs focused on utilizing the Azure Machine Learning Studio for various machine learning tasks, including model deployment as a service and employing different data exploration techniques to gain insights from datasets.
* **Skills Developed:** Through these labs, I gained practical experience in using a cloud-based machine learning platform (Azure ML Studio), deploying trained models for real-world applications, and applying systematic methods for understanding and preparing data for machine learning models.
* **Link to Lab Materials:** (Optional) If you have specific folders for different labs (e.g., `MSLE_Skillable_Labs/Azure_ML_Deployment/`, `MSLE_Skillable_Labs/Data_Exploration/`), you can mention them.
* **Brief Reflection:** The MSLE Skillable Labs provided valuable hands-on experience with industry-standard cloud tools and workflows. They reinforced the theoretical concepts learned in the course and provided practical skills in deploying and managing machine learning solutions.

### Deep Learning Tools & Frameworks

This section outlines my experience and understanding of various deep learning tools and frameworks explored during the course:

* **Frameworks Explored:** The primary deep learning framework I gained practical experience with during this project was PyTorch, which was used for implementing the diffusion model. I also gained an understanding of TensorFlow and Keras through the introductory VGG16 lab.
* **Tools Utilized:** I utilized Jupyter Notebooks (or Google Colab) as the primary environment for developing and experimenting with deep learning models. Libraries such as Matplotlib and potentially Seaborn were used for data visualization and analysis.
* **Key Concepts Applied:** Through the VGG16 lab, I understood the architecture of a pre-trained convolutional neural network and the process of making predictions. In the diffusion model project, I applied concepts such as neural network architectures (U-Net), training loops, and the principles of forward and reverse diffusion. I also gained a conceptual understanding of time embedding and CLIP evaluation.
* **Brief Reflection:** Working with PyTorch for the diffusion model provided a deeper understanding of the flexibility and power of this framework for implementing custom deep learning models. The VGG16 lab offered a valuable introduction to pre-trained models and the broader deep learning ecosystem.
